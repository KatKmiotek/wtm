 #### Hi! My name is Kat!  
 I am a career changer, did a coding bootcamp nearly 3 years ago and it was the best decision I have made.  
 I help as coorganiser at the __ [codebar](https://codebar.io/glasgow) __.  I work as Quality Engineer at __ [Zoopla](https://zoopla.blog/) __.  
 The role itself means performing a task that ensures the quality of the software product through its life cycle. Tests  performed by QE can include functional tests (like E2E), non-functional tests (like accessibility, performance,  security tests etc).   

 I write a __ [blog](https://www.katk.dev/) __ , take part in conferences and speak on podcasts to train myself to be extrovert.
