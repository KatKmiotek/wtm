 I am a career changer, did a coding bootcamp nearly 3 years ago and it was the best decision I have made.  
 I help as coorganiser at the __ codebar __.  I work as Quality Engineer at __ Zoopla __.  
 If you are not familiar with this job title maybe you heard about Automation Tester, 
 Quality Assurance Engineer, Automation Engineer, SDET (Software Development Engineer in Tests) - yes,
 there are many hats for this role! The role itself means performing a task that ensures the quality of the software product through its life cycle. Tests  performed by QE can include functional tests (like E2E), non-functioinal tests (like accessibility, performance,  security tests etc).
